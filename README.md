# Freezing-of-Gait-Detection

FOG is a condition often experienced by individuals with Parkinson's disease,
where they temporarily feel unable to move, particularly while walking. Detecting
these episodes is crucial for improving patient safety and mobility.
Symptoms:-  
• Sudden stopping while walking.                                                                                       
• Difficulty starting to walk, often described as a "frozen" sensation.  
• Short, shuffling steps.  

# Objective 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive ensemble
learning model for analyzing and predicting freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with
Parkinson's Disease. By integrating various data types—including medical records,
movement patterns, and sensor data—this model aims to identify patterns and
key indicators that signal FOG episodes. The use of ensemble learning techniques
allows for improved prediction accuracy by combining the strengths of multiple
algorithms, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture the complex
interplay of factors contributing to FOG. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide
insights that could lead to better management and treatment strategies for
patients experiencing FOG.
